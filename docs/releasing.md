# Releasing & versioning

`hmcts-fastapi-azure-auth` is published to the HMCTS **`hmcts-lib`** Azure DevOps
Artifacts feed (the same feed as the HMCTS Java libraries) by
[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](../.github/workflows/build.yml). This is the
single source of truth for how versions are produced and published.

## Versioning scheme

The artefact version is derived by [`hmcts/artefact-version-action`](https://github.com/hmcts/artefact-version-action)
(the same action the Java libraries use) and then normalised to
[PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/).

| Trigger | Version | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Push to `main`** (draft candidate) | `<base>.dev<run_number>+<sha>` | `0.2.0.dev47+46dfd2f` | Developmental release. `.dev<n>` sorts correctly across drafts; `+<sha>` is the commit (a hex SHA is only PEP 440-legal in the `+local` segment). Same form `setuptools-scm` produces. |
| **Published GitHub Release** | `<base>` (clean) | `0.2.0` | No `+local` segment. |

`<base>` comes from `version` in `pyproject.toml`.

> **Why not just `X.Y.Z+sha`, `X.Y.Z-sha`, or `X.Y.Z_sha`?** PEP 440 forbids `-`
> and `_` as separators, and a hex SHA cannot follow a `.` (release/`.dev`/`.post`
> segments are numeric). A SHA is only valid in the `+local` segment — so keeping
> the SHA *requires* a `+`, and pairing it with `.dev<n>` makes it the recognised
> dev-build idiom rather than a bare local version.

## Cutting a release

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` (e.g. `0.2.0` → `0.3.0`) and merge that to `main`.
2. Create a **GitHub Release** tagged for that version and publish it.
3. The `release`-triggered `publish` job builds and uploads the clean version
   (`0.3.0`) to the `hmcts-lib` feed.

Every merge to `main` in between publishes a draft (`…​.dev<n>+<sha>`), so the feed
always has an installable build of the latest `main`.

## Consuming the package

The feed is private — see the [Installation](../README.md#installation) section of
the README for the `--index-url` and authentication options.

## Required infrastructure

- **Org secrets** `AZURE_DEVOPS_ARTIFACT_USERNAME` and `AZURE_DEVOPS_ARTIFACT_TOKEN`
  must be available to this repository (they authenticate the `twine` upload; the
  same credentials the Java Gradle publish uses).
- **CodeQL** only runs when the repository is public
  (`if: github.event.repository.visibility == 'public'`) — GitHub Advanced Security
  is disabled at org level for private/internal repos, so it is skipped until then
  and auto-enables on going public.
